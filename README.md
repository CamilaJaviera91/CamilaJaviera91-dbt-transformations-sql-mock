# dbt transformations: sql mock data

## âœ… How would you do it step by step?

1. Create a new repository

- In this case we name it:

```
dbt-transformations-sql-mock
```

- And we created it directly on GitHub.

2. Clone it to your PC

```
git clone git@github.com:YOUR-USER/dbt-transformations-sql-mock-data.git
cd your/user/path/dbt-transformations-sql-mock
```

3. Initialize the DBT project

```
dbt init transformations
```

- To run dbt init transformations, you need to have Python and DBT properly installed.
